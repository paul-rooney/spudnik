            <em>The year is 1932. The place is pre-WWII Germany. In Secret Hitler, players are German politicians
            attempting to hold a fragile liberal government together and stem the rising tide of Fascism. Watch out
            though&mdash;there are secret Fascists among you, and one player is Secret Hitler.</em>

              <h2>Overview</h2>
            </summary>
            <p>
              At the beginning of the game, each player is secretly assigned to one of three roles:
              <strong>Liberal, Fascist, or Hitler.</strong> The Liberals have a majority, but they don’t know for sure who
              anyone is. Fascists must resort to secrecy and sabotage to accomplish their goals. Hitler plays for the
              Fascist team, and the Fascists know Hitler’s identity from the outset, but Hitler doesn’t know the Fascists
              and must work to figure them out.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The Liberals win by enacting five Liberal Policies or killing Hitler. The Fascists win by enacting six
              Fascists policies, or if Hitler is elected Chancellor after three Fascist Policies have been
              enacted.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Whenever a Fascist Policy is enacted, the government becomes more powerful, and the President is granted a
              single-use power which must be used before the next round can begin. It doesn’t matter what team the President
              is on; in fact, even Liberal players might be tempted to enact a Fascist Policy to gain new powers.

              Secret Hitler is played in rounds. Each round has an <strong>Election</strong> to form a government, a
              <strong>Legislative Session</strong> to enact a new Policy, and an <strong>Executive Action</strong> to
              exercise governmental power.

                  <p>
                    At the beginning of a new round, the President placard moves clockwise to the next player, who is the new
                    Presidential Candidate.

                  <p>
                    The Presidential Candidate chooses a Chancellor Candidate by passing the Chancellor placard to any other
                    eligible player. The Presidential Candidate is free to discuss Chancellor options with the table to build
                    consensus and make it more likely the government gets elected.

                  <p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    The last <em>elected</em> President and Chancellor are “term-limited”, and ineligible to be nominated as
                    Chancellor Candidate.

                        <em>Term limits apply to the President and Chancellor who were last elected, not to the last pair
                        nominated.</em>

                        <em>Term limits only affect nominations to the Chancellorship; anyone can be President, even someone

                  <h4>Vote on the government</h4>
                  <p>
                    Once the Presidential Candidate has chosen an eligible Chancellor Candidate, players may discuss the
                    proposed government until everyone is ready to vote. Every player, including the Candidates, votes on the
                    proposed government. Once everyone is ready to vote, reveal your Ballot cards simultaneously so that
                    everyone’s vote is public.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>If the vote is a tie, or if a majority of players votes no:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    The vote fails. The Presidential Candidate misses this chance to be elected, and the President placard
                    moves clockwise to the next player. The Election Tracker is advanced by one Election.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Election Tracker:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    If the group rejects three governments in a row, the country is thrown into chaos. Immediately reveal the
                    Policy on top of the Policy deck and enact it. Any power granted by this Policy is ignored, but the
                    Election Tracker resets, and existing term-limits are forgotten. All players become eligible to hold the
                    office of Chancellor for the next Election. If there are fewer than three tiles remaining in the Policy
                    deck at this point, shuffle them with the Discard pile to create a new Policy deck.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Any time a new Policy tile is played face-up, the Election Tracker is reset, whether it was enacted by an
                    elected government or enacted by the frustrated populace.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>If a majority of players votes yes:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    The Presidential Candidate and Chancellor Candidate become the new President and Chancellor, respectively.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p><strong>If three or more Fascist Policies have been enacted already:</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        Ask if the new Chancellor is Hitler. If so, the game is over and the Fascists win. Otherwise, other
                        players know for sure the Chancellor is not Hitler.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Proceed as usual to the Legislative Session.</p>
                </li>

                <h3>Legislative Session</h3>
              </summary>
              <p>
                During the Legislative Session, the President and Chancellor work together to enact a new Policy in secret.
                The President draws the top three tiles from the Policy deck, looks at them in secret, and discards one tile
                face down into the Discard pile. The remaining two tiles go to the Chancellor, who looks in secret, discards
                one Policy tile face down, and enacts the remaining Policy by placing the tile face up on the corresponding
                board.
              </p>

              <p>
                Verbal and nonverbal communication between the President and Chancellor is forbidden. The President and
                Chancellor MAY NOT pick Policies to play at random, shuffle the tiles before discarding one, or do anything
                else clever to avoid secretly and intentionally selecting a Policy. Additionally, the President should hand
                both Policies over at the same time, rather than one at a time to gauge the Chancellor’s reaction. Attempting
                to telegraph the contents of your hand using randomness or any other unusual selection procedure violates the
                spirit of the game. Don’t do it.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Discarded Policy tiles should never be revealed to the group. Players must rely on the word of the
                President and Chancellor, who are free to lie.</strong>
              </p>

              <hr />

              <p><em>About lying:</em></p>
              <p>
                Often, some players learn things that the rest of the players don’t know, like when the President and
                Chancellor get to see the Policy tiles, or when a President uses the Investigate power to see someone’s Party
                Membership card. You can always lie about hidden knowledge in Secret Hitler. The only time players MUST tell
                the truth is in game-ending, Hitler-related scenarios: a player who is Hitler must say so if assassinated or
                if elected Chancellor after three Fascist Policies have been enacted.
              </p>

              <hr />

              <p>
                <strong>If there are fewer than three tiles remaining in the Policy deck at the end of a Legislative
                Session,</strong>
                shuffle them with the Discard pile to create a new Policy deck. Unused Policy tiles should never be revealed,
                and they should not simply be placed on top of the new Policy deck.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>If the government enacted a Fascist Policy that covered up a Presidential Power,</strong> the sitting
                President gets to use that power. Proceed to the Executive Action.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>If the government enacted a Liberal Policy or a Fascist Policy that grants no Presidential Power,</strong>
                begin a new round with a new Election.
              </p>
            </details>

              <summary class="rules__subheading-block">
                <h3>Executive Action</h3>
              </summary>
              <p>
                If the newly-enacted Fascist Policy grants a Presidential Power, the President must use it before the next
                round can begin. Before using a power, the President is free to discuss the issue with other players, but
                ultimately the President gets to decide how and when the power is used. Gameplay cannot continue until the
                President uses the power. Presidential Powers are used only once; they don’t stack or roll over to future
                turns.
              </p>

              <h4>Presidential Powers</h4>

              <p><strong>Investigate Loyalty</strong></p>
              <p>
                The President chooses a player to investigate. Investigated players must hand their Party Membership card (not
                Secret Role card!) to the President, who checks the player’s loyalty in secret and then returns the card to
                the player. The President may share (or lie about!) the results of their investigation at their discretion. No
                player may be investigated twice in the same game.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Call Special Election</strong></p>
              <p>
                The President chooses any other player at the table to be the next Presidential Candidate by passing that
                player the Presidential placard. Any player can become President—even players that are term-limited. The new
                President nominates an eligible player as Chancellor Candidate and the Election proceeds as usual.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>A Special Election does not skip any players. After a Special Election, the President placard returns to
                the left of the President who enacted the Special Election.</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                If the President passes the presidency to the next player in the rotation, that player would get to run for
                President twice in a row: once for the Special Election and once for their normal shift in the Presidential
                rotation.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Policy Peek</strong></p>
              <p>
                The President secretly looks at the top three tiles in the Policy deck and then returns them to the top of the
                deck without changing the order.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Execution</strong></p>
              <p>
                The President executes one player at the table by saying “I formally execute [player name].” If that player is
                Hitler, the game ends in a Liberal victory. If the executed player is not Hitler, the table should not learn
                whether a Fascist or a Liberal has been killed; players must try to work out for themselves the new table
                balance. Executed players are removed from the game and may not speak, vote, or run for office.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Veto Power</strong></p>
              <p>
                The Veto Power is a special rule that comes into effect after five Fascist Policies have been enacted. For all
                Legislative Sessions after the fifth Fascist Policy is enacted, the Executive gains a
                <em>permanent new ability</em> to discard all three Policy tiles if <strong>both</strong> the Chancellor and
                President agree.
              </p>

              <p>
                The President draws three Policy tiles, discards one, and passes the remaining two to the Chancellor as usual.
                The Chancellor may, instead of enacting either Policy, say “I wish to veto this agenda”. If the President
                consents by saying, “I agree to the veto”, both Policies are discarded and the President placard passes to the
                left as usual. If the President does not consent, the Chancellor must enact a Policy as normal.
              </p>

              <p>Each use of the Veto Power represents an inactive government and advances the Election Tracker by one.</p>

                  figure out the game like a puzzle, so lying can put their team at a significant disadvantage.

                  <strong>Fascists most often win by electing Hitler, not by enacting six Policies!</strong> Electing Hitler
                  isn’t an optional or secondary win condition, it’s the core of a successful Fascist strategy. Hitler
                  should always play as a Liberal, and should generally avoid lying or getting into fights and disagreements
                  with other players. When the time comes, Hitler needs the Liberals’ trust to get elected. Even if Hitler
                  isn’t ultimately elected, the distrust sown among Liberals is key to getting Fascists elected late in the
                  game.

                  <strong>Ask other players to explain why they took an action.</strong> This is especially important with
                  Presidential Powers—in fact, ask ahead of time whom a candidate is thinking of
                  investigating/appointing/assassinating.

                  <strong>If a Fascist Policy comes up, there are only three possible culprits: The President, the Chancellor, or
                  the Policy Deck.</strong>
                  Try to figure out who (or what!) put you in this position.
